Keywords for Readings
---------------------

Select 3 keywords for each assigned reading. Keywords are terms that catch your eye, you think are central to the argument, confuse you, inspire you, get you thinking, etc. Keywords are used in each session to drive discussion.

Book Review Guidelines
----------------------

Due: Sessions 6 and 11, beginning of each class

Specs: Double-spaced, printed, and stapled. The length of the review should be 1000 words (+/- 10%).

Framework: The goal of this assignment is to give you some space to reflect in detail on one of the books we've read. Rather than simply describing what each chapter does, your essay should be _analytic_ in tone, focusing on some select issues / themes (you probably can't do more than a couple) that highlight the argument(s) the author is making, evidence presented, and your evaluation of it. You should be utilizing the genre conventions that you've seen in some of the academic book reviews you've researched.

You are welcome to draw on other academic literature to bolster your position (make sure to cite it properly). While different people will have different key takeaways, you should also strive to engage with it at a high enough level that, if someone only reads your review, they would get a good general sense of the work.

You should approach this task as both a generous and careful reader. Working in a critical mode doesn't mean "negative" but instead suggests a engaged, analytic, and evaluative investigation. You certainly may have critiques, but make sure you have done your best to think about how the author might respond, and situate your criticism accordingly.

Writing short assignments are also their own kind of challenge. Honing what you think, being concise, and making tough decisions about what is crucial to include are key components of this kind of work. Don't shortchange yourself on the time you spend on this.

Final Paper Guidelines
----------------------

Due: Two days after the last session

### Topic and Scope

The paper must be an _original written piece of work that takes up a topic covered within the domain of network cultures_. You can either draw from the subject areas covered in class or pick a topic exploring some other aspect of internet & society. This is your opportunity to really dig in and research a topic of your choosing related to the course (please make sure it does focus on cultural / sociological themes). You can do this by focusing on a deep literature review or, alternatively with permission, some original research. I'd encourage you to pick something you are excited and curious about, maybe even something you have some experience with.

A key factor in this assignment is that you demonstrate _a rigorous, scholarly analysis of the subject of your essay_. You cannot just be "in your own head" or making broad claims but must evidence your arguments by drawing on academic research. The key is that you find support for your argument in scenarios, research, and cases beyond your own personal experience. This will mean looking through journals, books on the subject, and seeking some good examples to build and anchor your argument.

### Specs

1.  You should engage with (i.e. draw on, cite, quote, be in conversation with) at least 5 peer-reviewed scholarly articles or books related to your topic. One can be drawn from our class readings but the additional ones should come from your independent lit search. If you are unsure of where to find good articles within this domain you can check out [my resource page](http://tltaylor.com/teaching/research-resources-for-students/). I encourage you to make use of the great reference librarians we have here at MIT.
2.  You should pick an established format (such as MLA or Chicago) for quoting and citing work (see links at my Research Resource page noted above for guidance). You must also include a complete bibliography at the end of the essay.
3.  Your overall word count for the piece should be 2500 words (for undergraduates) or 5000 words (for graduate students) (+/- 10% is fine).
4.  You must submit the work as a printed, double-spaced, stapled paper.
